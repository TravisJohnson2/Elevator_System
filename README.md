# Elevator_System

This Elevator System was designed in Verilog HDL using only combinational and sequential logic, and does not use a CPU.

This is the initial prototype. It is designed for an 8 story building, takes inputs from the Up and Down Buttons on each floor, and the elevator buttons inside the elevator car.  
It outputs the current floor the elevator is on.

Design is modelled using the Logisim file elevator_01.circ
